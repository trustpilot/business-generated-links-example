# Example implementation for business generated links in C#
This is an example implementation for creating business generated links. 

The example uses the open source NuGet library [AuthenticatedEncryption](https://github.com/trustpilot/nuget-authenticated-encryption) to do the encryption.

All the logic is kept inside [Program.cs](https://github.com/trustpilot/business-generated-links-example/blob/master/ExampleImplementation/Program.cs), to make it easy to follow.
